# Security & Privacy Policy

Welcome to the security and privacy policy for all JOLT projects. This document explains how we handle security issues and privacy matters regarding the index of WordPress plugins and themes, as well as all other JOLT repositories.

## Project Philosophy

I believe in full transparency throughout my development process. All JOLT projects are:

- **Privacy-focused:** User data is never collected without explicit consent, and privacy is a core design principle.
- **Secure by design:** Security considerations are integrated from the start, and vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.
- **Open Source:** All source code is publicly available for review, improvement, and community collaboration.
- **Transparent:** All development decisions, changes, and issues are documented openly, fostering trust and accountability.

If you have any questions about my development approach or want to contribute, feel free to reach out!

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security issue in any JOLT project, please report it as follows:

- **Send a direct message via X (formerly Twitter):** [https://x.com/DevJohnOltmans](https://x.com/DevJohnOltmans)
- **Include as subject:** Security Issue
- **Clearly describe the problem and provide steps to reproduce if possible.**

We aim to respond to reported vulnerabilities within 5 business days.

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate it if you report discovered vulnerabilities privately first and allow us the opportunity to resolve them before disclosing any details publicly.
