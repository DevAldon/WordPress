# Security, Privacy & Usage Policy

Welcome to the security, privacy, and usage policy for all JOLT projects. This document explains how we handle security issues, privacy matters, and the permitted use of the code within all repositories under the JOLT name, including the WordPress plugins and themes index.

---

## Project Philosophy

I believe in full transparency throughout my development process. All JOLT projects are:

- **Privacy-focused:** User data is never collected without explicit consent, and privacy is a core design principle.
- **Secure by design:** Security considerations are integrated from the start, and vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.
- **Open Source:** All source code is publicly available for review, improvement, and community collaboration.
- **Transparent:** All development decisions, changes, and issues are documented openly, fostering trust and accountability.

If you have any questions about my development approach or want to contribute, feel free to reach out!

## 1. Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security issue in any JOLT project, please report it as follows:

- **Send a direct message via X (formerly Twitter):** [https://x.com/DevJohnOltmans](https://x.com/DevJohnOltmans)
- **Include as subject:** Security Issue
- **Clearly describe the problem and provide steps to reproduce if possible.**

We aim to respond to reported vulnerabilities within 5 business days.

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate it if you report discovered vulnerabilities privately first and allow us the opportunity to resolve them before disclosing any details publicly.

## 2. Privacy Policy

### Transparency and Privacy

JOLT projects do not process or store any personal data from users unless explicitly stated otherwise.

#### What data do we process?

- **Publicly available data:** Only data that is already publicly visible on GitHub or in the respective project repositories.
- **No tracking:** We do not use tracking or analytics tools in JOLT projects unless clearly documented.
- **No external data sharing:** Data from these projects is not shared with third parties.

#### Your rights

If you believe that privacy-sensitive information is present in any JOLT repository, please contact us via [https://x.com/DevJohnOltmans](https://x.com/DevJohnOltmans) so we can correct or remove it.
